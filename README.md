# Photon-FloodSensor-2016
Particle.io Photon reading a MaxBotix I2CXL-MaxSonar via the I2C bus and pushing the data to the cloud, both as Particle.io events and to data.sparkfun.com. Forked from the 2016-2017 deployment of prototype flood sensors by the Snoqualmie Valley Preservation Alliance and modified to work with the Photon.
